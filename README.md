# TeleportMod

A simple teleport mod for DayZ that can reliably connect locations such as bunkers placed outside the map — or any other custom area. Originally created for use on a private server, the mod includes optional item-based activation and the ability to consume the item upon use (e.g. keycards).

## Planned Features

- Teleport delay
- Fade-in/fade-out transitions
- Sound/Alarm effects during teleportation
- Better visible notification

---

## Features

- Interactive teleport points attachable to any object
- Item requirements (e.g. crowbar, shovel, keycards)
- Item damage or consumption system
- Temporary teleport activation (time-limited use)
- Sound effects (work in progress – not fully implemented)
